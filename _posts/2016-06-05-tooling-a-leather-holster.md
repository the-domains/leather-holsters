Tooling leather for a form fitting concealed carry holster should not interfere with retention needed to hold the firearm in place under normal conditions. Many believe that it is not possible to have both decorative tooling and molded leather. If proper steps in construction are taken a well styled and safe holster can be built.

Methods for building such holster a similar to one without tooling. Consideration for circumference of the gun and thickness of the leather are still the first step to identifying stitch lines and the distance between them. This step is crucial in all holsters and time spent here will save you headaches later in construction.
